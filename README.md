# PASS Time Federation server configs
This repo contains the new and improved PASS Time Federation server configs, as of season 3. This repo will be updated as the server configs recieve changes. There are only 3 config files, since PTF only features a single mode in a single format.

## important note
This config also includes settings for [PASS Tweaks](https://github.com/SirBlockles/pass-tweaks), a plugin which adjusts gameplay specifically for PASS Time. PASS Tweaks is _required_ for any server on which an official PTF match is being played.
