# PASS Time Federation server configs
This repo contains the new and improved PASS Time Federation server configs, as of season 3. This repo will be updated as the server configs recieve changes. There are only 3 config files, since PTF only features a single mode in a single format.

## game rules
The first team to win 4 rounds total, wins the match.

The game is played in "halves" which end when a team wins 2 rounds. Halves also end after 3 rounds have passed or 30 minutes have passed, to prevent stalemates from making halves last forever. The number of halves you win does not matter - they are simply downtime for teams to strategize or take a pee break or whatever. There can also be more than two halves, despite the name.

For example: a team goes 2-0 in the first half, wins a round in the second half but then lose the other rounds, the third half would start off 3-2, and the first team would only need to win 1 round to win the match.

## important note
This config also includes settings for [PASS Tweaks](https://github.com/SirBlockles/pass-tweaks), a plugin which adjusts gameplay specifically for PASS Time. PASS Tweaks is _required_ for any server on which an official PTF match is being played.
